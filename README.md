# py-server
Node JS is offers the easiest way for creating client-servers models. Since it is event based system and works on interrupt calls rather than threads, there is no way you could reach a deadlock state. On top of this data gets recieved and sent as and when ready.

Therefore, installing a heavy server application such as Django or Apache - to do small monotonous task on the desk or network seems really a bad idea.

Having such a small setup serves two purposes:

1. Reduces Load:
    - if on the single system is "less exerted" and,
    - if on the network it "gets distributed".

2. Also, a web based application can be extended and scaled on your own wish and does not need any compilation process. Best if one part of the app crashes that will not render the whole application useless.

Introducing ! "localhost server used for hosting python and php applications - Handy tool for developers/script writers !!!"

Suggestions are always welcome !!!!
