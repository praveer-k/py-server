# py-server
Node JS offers the easiest way for creating client-servers models. Since it is event based system and works on interrupt calls rather than threads, there is no way you could reach a deadlock state. On top of this, data gets recieved and sent as and when ready.

Therefore, installing a heavy server application such as Django or Apache - to do small monotonous task on the desk or network seems really a bad idea.

Having such a small setup serves two purposes:

1. Reduces Load:
    - if on the single system is "less exerted" and,
    - if on the network it "gets distributed".

2. Extended and Scaled on demand:
    - The application can be extended and scaled on demand and does not need to go through any compilation process. 
    - Best if one part of the app crashes, it will not render the whole application useless.

Introducing ! "localhost server used for hosting python and php applications - Handy tool for developers/script writers !!!"
