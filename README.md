# py-server
Node JS is the best and the easiest way of creating client-servers models. Since it is event based system and works on interrupt calls rather than any threads, there is no way you may reah a deadlock state. On top of this data gets recieved and sent as a when ready.

Therefore, installing a heavy server applications such as Django or Apache - to do small monotonous task on the desk or network seems really a bad idea.

Having a small setup serves two purposes:
1. Load, if on the single system is "less exerted" and if on the network it "gets distributed".
2. Also, a web based application can be extended and scaled on your own wish and does not need any compilation process. Best if one part of the app crashes that will not render the whole application useless.

Introducing ! "localhost server used for hosting python and php applications - Handy tool for developers/script writers !!!"
